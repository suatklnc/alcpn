# Task ID: 10
# Title: Performance Optimization and Advanced Reporting
# Status: To Do
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize frontend and backend performance and implement advanced reporting features like price trend charts.
# Details:
Implement frontend optimizations like code-splitting and image optimization. Optimize database queries by adding indexes. Integrate Recharts to create a `ComparisonChart` component that visualizes price trends for materials over time.

# Test Strategy:
Use Lighthouse or Vercel Analytics to measure performance scores before and after optimizations. Test the chart component to ensure it renders correctly. Load test API endpoints to ensure they respond quickly.
