# Task ID: 9
# Title: Finalize CI/CD, Monitoring, and Deployment
# Status: To Do
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the complete CI/CD pipeline, configure monitoring and error tracking, and prepare for production deployment on Vercel.
# Details:
Create the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file for automated testing and deployment. Configure Vercel environment variables and `vercel.json`. Integrate Sentry for error tracking and Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Trigger the CI/CD pipeline by pushing to `develop` and `main` branches and verify all steps execute correctly. Intentionally create an error to confirm it's captured by Sentry. Review the Vercel Analytics dashboard.
