# Priority: low
# Description: Add functionality for users to export calculation results as a PDF and share them via a unique link.
# Details:
Integrate a library like `jspdf` to generate a PDF from the calculation results page. Add a 'PDF Export' button. Implement a 'Share' feature that generates a unique, shareable link to a read-only version of the calculation result.

# Test Strategy:
Test the PDF export functionality across different browsers. Test the sharing feature by opening a generated link in an incognito window and verifying the results are displayed correctly.
