# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Backend Web Scraping Service
# Status: To Do
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core web scraping service to fetch material prices from external sources using Puppeteer/Cheerio and implement caching with Redis.
# Details:
Set up Puppeteer/Cheerio for web scraping. Implement `BaseScraper` and `ConfigurableScraper` classes. Integrate Upstash Redis for caching scraped price data. Implement rate limiting using `@upstash/ratelimit` to avoid being blocked.

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests for each scraper to ensure it can correctly fetch and parse prices. Test the caching logic to verify that subsequent requests return a cached result. Test the rate limiting middleware.
