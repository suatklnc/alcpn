# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement User Account Features (History & Saving)
# Status: To Do
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Allow registered users to view their past calculations and save/name them for future reference.
# Details:
Create the `/api/user/calculations` endpoint to fetch a user's calculation history. Develop a 'My Calculations' page to list past calculations. Implement the detail view for a past calculation on the `/calculation/[id]` page.

# Test Strategy:
As a logged-in user, perform a calculation and verify it appears in the history. Test that clicking a historical calculation correctly loads its details. Ensure a user can only see their own calculations.
